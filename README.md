# Design Patterns in Python

Repo containing simple examples of Design Patterns in Python. The examples are from the awesome [refactoring.guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/)!

The examples have no explanations just plain code, so I can remember the patterns implementation and play around with them.
